### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let me introduce myself, my name is Fawwaz Ikbar. A Computer Science Student who has a high interest in learning and enjoys learning new things. Honest, responsible personality, able to work together in a team and think positively and accustomed to looking ahead before doing something.<br>

I have experience working as a team on the PKM-PI SICODE 2023 Team. This team built a programming training website to hone students' programming skills. In this team, I am the one who designs the questions given to students.<br>
